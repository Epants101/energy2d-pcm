# energy2d-pcm
A moderate rewrite of Energy2d to allow the use of PCMs. It is not listed as a fork because the build system was completely rewritten to run on Maven, which involved completely changing the directory structure.

To run (from the energy2d folder): 
java -cp ./target/energy2d-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.energy2d.App
